# Build custom docker image with additional modules

This project contains a Dockerfile that allows you to create a custom docker
image with any number of additional dynamic modules.

## Building

To build a new docker image it's only necessary to provide the `modules` build
argument with a comma separated list of git repository URLs to be included in
the image. Example:

```
git clone https://github.com/seifrajhi/custom-docker-image-modules
cd custom-docker-image-modules
docker build --build-arg modules=https://github.com/vozlt/nginx-module-vts.git:v0.1.17,https://github.com/openresty/echo-nginx-module.git .
```

## Flavors

Flavors are a way to group a set of modules to generate a custom nginx image.
Flavors can be added by editing the `flavors.json` file and listing the module
URLs.

To build a flavor you can use the provided Makefile:

```
make image flavor=tsuru nginx_version=1.21.4
```

To build a flavor, `jq` is required, cf. [download section of jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)
